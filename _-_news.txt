news_technology_content_p21█{1}: "The rockets we are currently developing are far from competitive. Let's hope it's not just a simple boast to make more profits on the stock market. Does {0} really have better technologies? Will we ever set foot on Mars?

news_fail_content_p14█Another day, another unpleasant news from the camp {0}. A rocket that belongs to a billionaire named {1} ended its mission in a rather unexpected and loud way.

news_fail_content_p23█The causes of the accident are not yet well identified and will be investigated in detail in the coming months. Regardless of the cause, the explosion means a major image loss for {0}. 
news_fail_content_p24█The whole team is working hard to explain the reasons for the explosion. We will soon find out whether the equipment failed, whether it was a human failure or whether it was an act of unfair competition.
news_fail_content_p25█The bitterness of the situation is not hidden by the fans of the company all over the world, for whom {1} from the beginning of its activity was the embodiment of innovation and ideal entrepreneur. "I am sick and tired and I am selling all my shares now! I want to see beautiful flights, not explosions..." - was written by @denis-szwarc, the user of reddit.com.

news_bankrupt_content_p12█Problems with exploding rockets, failure to comply with contracts and mess in financial documents are probably not the only mistakes of the chairman of {0}. {1} today declared bankruptcy.
news_bankrupt_content_p13█We will probably wait a long time for the first successful crew mission to Mars. The market does not forgive the mistakes made by {1}, the owner of {0}. The company was closed today.

news_bankrupt_content_p22█The emotional statement that {1} sent to the media does not lack bitter words towards the other members of the management board. "My dreams were stolen (...) by traitors and thieves. I did everything in my power and now I am left with nothing. I'm sorry."

news_FundraisingHats_header█{1} has sold 20,000 hats with the {0} logo. The perfect way to finance space business?
news_FundraisingHats_content█{1} is amazing. Crazy, but still amazing. {0}'s CEO was told by the management to add some cash to the company's budget in the sharpest possible way.
