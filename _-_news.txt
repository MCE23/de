news_technology_content_p21█{1}: "Die Raketen, die wir derzeit entwickeln, sind weit davon entfernt, wettbewerbsfähig zu sein.

news_technology_content_p22█"Wir hoffen, in die Zukunft blicken zu können. Verbesserungen an unseren Raketen werden es uns nicht nur ermöglichen, größere Ladungen in die Umlaufbahn zu bringen.

news_technology_content_p24█"Ich bin sicher, es wird funktionieren!", sagte {1} auf der gestrigen Konferenz. Er will die Raketen bergen, die nach dem Start der Nutzlast in die Umlaufbahn auf die Erde gefallen sind.

Dies ist ein weiterer Schritt hin zu billigeren Flügen ins All und zum Mars!

news_fail_content_p13█It would seem that the sound of rockets taking off near cities is the smallest problem for their citizens. Until the rockets start to explode. In the morning, our office began to receive complaints from anxious citizens who have been woken up by a loud explosion.
news_fail_content_p14█Another day, another unpleasant news from the camp {0}. A rocket that belongs to a billionaire named {1} ended its mission in a rather unexpected and loud way.

news_fail_content_p21█The causes of the explosion are currently being investigated. The company's CEO, {1}, commented on the situation in a short Twitter post: "The one who does nothing makes no mistakes. Cheers!". There was also a picture added to the post - a photograph of a half-empty bottle of polish vodka "Żubrówka". 
news_fail_content_p22█Our anonymous source, closely associated with the company, informs that in 3 minutes from the launch of the rocket there was a failure of hydraulics in the combustion chamber of the engine. Details will probably be announced at the press conference planned for today. 
news_fail_content_p23█The causes of the accident are not yet well identified and will be investigated in detail in the coming months. Regardless of the cause, the explosion means a major image loss for {0}. 
news_fail_content_p24█The whole team is working hard to explain the reasons for the explosion. We will soon find out whether the equipment failed, whether it was a human failure or whether it was an act of unfair competition.
news_fail_content_p25█The bitterness of the situation is not hidden by the fans of the company all over the world, for whom {1} from the beginning of its activity was the embodiment of innovation and ideal entrepreneur.

news_bankrupt_content_p21█This sad end of the dreams about conquering space is only the beginning of {0} financial problems. According to the information we have received, the company is flooded with lawsuits for property damage. All because of the rocket parts falling on private homes.
news_bankrupt_content_p22█The emotional statement that {1} sent to the media does not lack bitter words towards the other members of the management board. "My dreams were stolen (...) by traitors and thieves. I did everything in my power and now I am left with nothing. I'm sorry."
news_bankrupt_content_p23█The press conference of {0} was a dramatic one. {1} appeared on it with a black eye. As he explained, there was a small fight with another member of the management board. Unofficially, we learned that it was the last $100 bill that was left in the company's safe.

news_FundraisingHats_header█{1} has sold 20,000 hats with the {0} logo. The perfect way to finance space business?
news_FundraisingHats_content█{1} is amazing. Crazy, but still amazing. {0}'s CEO was told by the management to add some cash to the company's budget in the sharpest possible way.
