company_ceoAndCompanyMustHaveName█Company and the CEO must have a name!

earthxWelcome█Hey, Elo- oh, this is you... <color=#64B5F6>{0}</color>!&%I see you've finally set up the rocket company you've mentioned before. "<color=#64B5F6>{1}</color>" is actually a cool name! I have to tell you, you're very brave.&%&%Big companies that have a monopoly on the launch provider market have not invested in some newer technology for years. They're still using inefficient boosters and obsolete engines. What if they could land their rockets back on Earth? Then it would be possible to send multiple payloads with only 1 rocket! I hope you can build a landing rocket or even a sidebooster one in a few years.&%&%Good luck!

iss_CRSHeader█ISS Commercial Resupply Services
iss_CRSContent█Hey!&%&%You've proven you can launch rockets and cargo capsules. For this reason you were chosen by the creator of this game to regularly supply the international space station for several years.&%&%You are forced to do this because I have not programmed the option to refuse, and the game without this mission would be... boring.

iss_CCPHeader█ISS Commercial Crew Program
iss_CCPContent█Hey!&%&%Your company has grown very much since its foundation. Anyway, have you ever imagined yourself as the CEO of one of the biggest space companies in the world? Well, neither have I.&%&%But the game goes on and I see that you have a lot on your mind, so I give you 6 additional crew missions (the creator of the game detected that you already have the necessary capsule). Crew missions must be sent regularly to the international space station.&%&%Oh, I almost forgot, make sure your rocket doesn't explode, or it'll be bad if you burn people, lol.

iss_catHeader█Please help!
iss_catContent█My cat, Balwina, is in very bad condition... I have to stay on the ISS for another 4 months and I'm very afraid, that I will never be able to met her again!!&%&%Because of this fact, PLEASE put it on your next ISS mission :(&%&%Please consider it and thank you,&%&%Teresa

iss_technicianHeader█Emergency on the ISS
iss_technicianContent█Good evening,&%&%There are currently 4 astronauts on the International Space Station. Their lives are in danger because of medium-sized leakage in one of the modules.&%&%We know, that your company does not have any crew capsules, that's why you will need to launch a technician in a cargo capsule.&%&%Please do it as fast as you can AND don't talk with the press about that flight. No one can know that we're about to launch a human in a cargo capsule!&%&%Thanks for your cooperation, you will get paid after the mission.
